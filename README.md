# AQI Index Dashboard Using Power BI
## Project Overview
This project presents an Air Quality Index (AQI) dashboard developed using Power BI, which provides insights into air pollution levels across various cities and regions. The dashboard includes key metrics such as the average concentration of pollutants (CO, NO, SO2, PM2.5) and highlights the most and least polluted cities. The aim is to help environmental agencies, policymakers, and the public understand pollution trends and take necessary actions.

## Key Insights
**Average CO (Carbon Monoxide)**: The average concentration of CO across all measured areas.

**Average NO (Nitrogen Oxide)**: The average concentration of NO across cities.

**Average SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)**: Insights into the average SO2 concentration across the monitored regions.

**Average PM2.5**: The average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across cities, which is a critical indicator of air quality.

**Top 3 Polluted Cities**: Cities with the highest recorded AQI values, indicating poor air quality.

**Top 3 Least Polluted Cities**: Cities with the lowest AQI values, representing better air quality.

**AQI Trend by Year**: A historical view of AQI levels to track air quality changes over time.

**Area-wise AQI**: Breakdown of AQI levels across different areas or regions, helping identify pollution hotspots.
